    - Beneficiary
    - Donor
    - Charity Organization
    - Exchange store
    
    The charity organizations will get the information of needy people and create charity post on  the platform. 
    
    Donors will get to know about charity projects on the platform and they will donate to that particular post. Beneficiaries upload their information to the platform for help, they can get and spend tokens in exchange stores. 
    
    Every transaction occurred during this transactions will be uploaded to the charity platform.
    
    The exchange stores supply services or goods to the beneficiaries to obtain tokens. 
    
    The tokens can be exchanged for real money by charity organizations.
    
    The flow of funds has been fully recorded on the blockchain, which allows transactions to be tracked and transparent.
